## ðŸ“œ Overview

Built on an ESP32 with an electro magnet, some leds and an I2S microphone.

## ðŸ§® Processing

To detect beats we are calculating the energy of the microphone signal.
We firstly use a biquad filter as low pass to isolate the beat frequencies.

<!-- But we have to keep in mind what frequencies we are looking for to mitigate the aliasing artifacts. -->

Let say we sample with a rate of $f_s=16000$,
a window size of $N=64$ and is looking for the energy of frequencies between $[0-f_c[$ where $f_c=150hz$.

We calculate the energy of the low pass filtered sampled signal using rms:

$E_{RMS}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}x_i^2}$

If the energy is higher than the previous energy sample, we update to that value else we do a linear interpolation.

This helps with spikes, as the magnet has time to attract the fluid before settling down.

<!-- This can be use to calculate the bin size of $bin_{size}=\lceil\frac{f_c \cdot N}{f_s}\rceil\approx 10$ . -->

<!-- We are only interested in the max energy (or total), as a beat does not have to fill the range. -->
